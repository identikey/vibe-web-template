description: When creating a user interface, rules for components and style
---

Whenever creating a user interface, first think if there is a shadcn component that will provide what we need. To add this, run: `bun x shadcn <component_name>`. The components can be found at https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/docs/components

Always use tailwind styles. Avoid custom CSS if at all possible.
